Cube Demo by Corey Tabaka (me@coreytabaka.com)

This is a cool little demo showing off arbitrarily shaped windows, defined by
3D geometry. It took a bit of work, since Windows doesn't really allow mixing
OpenGL and transparent window drawing. I wrote this demo mainly because a lot
of people said it couldn't be done cleanly (and to add to my resume).


Requirements

Windows 2000/XP
Graphics accelerator supporting WGL_ARB_pbuffer and WGL_ARB_pixel_format


Optional

Graphics accelerator supporting ARB_fragment_program and ARB_vertex_program

If support for these extensions is found, the demo will load lighting.cg and
lightingfrag.cg and use them for per pixel lighting.


Testing

I have only tested on GeForce Quadro FX 3000, GeForce FX 5200, GeFroce2,
ATI Mobility Radeon 7500, and a newer Mobil Intel chip that I have forgotten.
All seem to work fine. The GeForce FXs are the onyl cards supporting ARB vp/fp
that I have had a chance to test with. I would like to try a nice ATI card
sometime, when I get the chance.
